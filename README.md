# the_known_universe_as_a_digital_model

my response to reading this article

it would require 2 Yottabytes to 10 Yottabytes of space

a 10YB hard drive
# not mathematically acurate since there are no known details descrbing everything completely incorported mathematically just a loose based guesstimate as any other theoretical physicist

a physical atom existent would be represented as 1 a non existent atom would be represented as a 0

(the science article explains counting electrons , neutrons, protons, quarks individually as bits I dont agree with this and suggest to just figure an existent atom as a 1 for existent encompassing physical space and 0 for non existent where it doesnt encompass any physical space)

since not all matter has known electrons , protons and neutrons in certain occurances in an atomic cloud where certain atomic clouds per atom might only have a certain amount of electrons , protons or neutrons 

I continued to figure my mathematical model based off of 6371 kilometers of earth's diameter
where the actual earth is a guesstimated physical mass of 6 septillion kilo grams

where that would be physical matter that encompasses spatial (space)

then figuring the closest physical star to earth is 90 million miles or 180 million miles on average as the earth orbits 180 millions miles completey around the sun (Which would describe a large circular section of "empty space" or 0 grams 

I did not figure the secondary part of the line distance as 150 trillion miles to the nearest star which is 25 light years away as part of this continued speculated mathematical "guesstimate"

1.4 * 10^8 km distance from the sun to the earth
2.8 * 10^8 km = 0 grams (180 million miles) of 0 grams of empty nothingness

6371km = 1  6 septillion kilo grams


the known visible universe if 15 billion light years @ 5.8 trillion miles (6) per light year

1 light year = 9.656×10^12 kilometers (9.6 trillion kilometers) * 9.6 * 15 = 144 billion * trillion = 144 sextillion kilometers

which is 0.02 * 10^47 kilograms (if EVERY SINGLE AREA OF THE UNIVERSE WAS A SOLID FORM OF MATTER ROUGHLY IF THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED AS A SOLID AT THE STARTING POINT INSTEAD OF EXPLODING WITH THE BIG BANG EVENT)

3.8 * 10^33  known grams in the universe (if you have a ratio of empty space compared to space with physical matter in this version of the known universe exploding as the big bang event instead of expanding a complete physical solid with no empty space)

0.017 mol iron (per gram) * 6.022 10^23
0.08 mol carbon (per gram) * 6.022 10^23

1.8 * 10^56 bits                quadrillon * sextillion yottabytes
8 * 10^60 bits
