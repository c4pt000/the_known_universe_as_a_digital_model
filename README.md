# the_known_universe_as_a_digital_model

my response to reading this article

https://www.livescience.com/how-many-bits-in-the-universe

it would require 2 Yottabytes to 10 Yottabytes of space

a 10YB hard drive

a physical atom existent would be represented as 1 a non existent atom would be represented as a 0

(the science article explains counting electrons , neutrons, protons, quarks individually as bits I dont agree with this and suggest to just figure an existent atom as a 1 for existent encompassing physical space and 0 for non existent where it doesnt encompass any physical space)

since not all matter has known electrons , protons and neutrons in certain occurances in an atomic cloud where certain atomic clouds per atom might only have a certain amount of electrons , protons or neutrons

5.97×10^24 kg (kilograms) mass of earth

										6 septillion kilo grams

6371km 

15 billion light years

5.8 (6) trillion miles, 

1 light year = 9.656×10^12 kilometers


9.6 trillion kilometers for 1 light year 





144*10 ^21 (144 sextillion) kilometers

6371km = 1  6 septillion kilo grams

2.8 * 10^8 km = 0 grams
